. Static and dynamic provisioning
-------------------------------
SC-- > used for dynamic provisioning
 PV --> representation of external storage
 PVC --> a claim that can make to mount the volume
StatefulSet vs Deployment
StatefulSet is for DB applications, it keeps the network identity same. it uses headless service 

 EBS or EFS
for DB we have to use EBS, we use dynamic provisioning

 1. install EBS CSI driver.
 2. give access to EC2 servers.
 3. creation of storage class - Sc creation is not depends on application, it is admin activity completely outside application manifest files.
 4. create PVC and mount to the pod.

Helm charts 
-----------
1.building and pushing images --> through CI can be done 
2.manifest, how to run the image ---> input latest version 


1.we will keep the important files aside,edit only required fields

DRY RUN
without touching main files,,we will send parameters

example
#!bin/bash 
NAME= Shekar 
-------
#!bin/bash
NAME=$1
-----
HELM purpose is two types:
1. parameterise the kubernetes manifest files
2.it is kubernetes package manager

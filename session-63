. Static and dynamic provisioning
-------------------------------
SC-- > used for dynamic provisioning
 PV --> representation of external storage
 PVC --> a claim that can make to mount the volume
StatefulSet vs Deployment
StatefulSet is for DB applications, it keeps the network identity same. it uses headless service 

 EBS or EFS
for DB we have to use EBS, we use dynamic provisioning

 1. install EBS CSI driver.
 2. give access to EC2 servers.
 3. creation of storage class - Sc creation is not depends on application, it is admin activity completely outside application manifest files.
 4. create PVC and mount to the pod.
